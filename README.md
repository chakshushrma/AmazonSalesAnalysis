What it's about:
This project focused on analyzing sales data from Amazon to understand which products and customer types performed best.

What was done:
I used Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy to clean and analyze over 50,000 sales records. Then, I used Matplotlib to create graphs showing trends like top-selling products and customer purchasing habits.

Why it matters:
The results can help improve marketing and stocking strategies, targeting the right products to the right customers.
